# ALIEN: MUTHUR

A retro text game inspired by the Alien franchise. You must use the MUTHUR terminal onboard the USCSS Rhea to survive the xenomorph breach. Beware though, MUTHUR serves the ruthless Weyland-Yutani corporation so may have an agenda of her own...


## About

I was inspired after re-watching the original Alien movie and seeing how chilling the interactions with the ship's MUTHUR AI could be. Being a writer I was curious whether it was possible to create suspense and horror with nothing but green text moving across a screen, capturing that classic 70's/80's idea of what AI would be. I was also curious to do a coding project which was very different to my day-to-day work in data science.

The premise: You are a deck officer onboard the USCSS Rhea and must interact with the ship's MUTHUR terminal to navigate the emergency protocols and survive. 


## Features

- Classic CRT terminal aesthetic with green monochrome graphics, reminiscent of the original 1979 Alien film
- Two unique puzzle mechanics: a maze system-routing game and tactical bulkhead control to blow the xenomorph out the airlock and survive
- Dynamic alien AI that hunts you through the ship in the final puzzle
- Authentic retro computing interface
- Win/lose endings based on your success
